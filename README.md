## Work Experience

### Java Software Engineer (Backend) @ **Pulse for Integrated Solutions GmbH** _(Dec 2024 ‚Äì Present)_

#### Achievements
<!-- 
* Designed a **new architecture for the communication protocol** between the server and the ECG device.

  * Applied **Single Responsibility Principle** and enforced **decoupling** by ensuring components rely on **contracts and abstractions**.
  * Achieved a design that is **open for extension, closed for modification**, supporting future scalability with minimal refactoring.
  * Promoted **reusability** and eliminated redundancy through clean modular structure.
  * Implemented an automatic **message parsing mechanism** by mapping message structures to POJOs and using **Java Reflection** to deserialize messages dynamically.

Designed and implemented the ECG Device Manager as a core component in a modular monolith architecture.
- Session Manager: 
  - Manages patient session lifecycle.
  - Controls start and end of sessions on the ECG device.

- Streaming Manager: 
  - Tracks lifecycle of real-time patient data streaming.
  - Controls start, stop, and restart of ECG data streams.
  - Ensures consistency between the current session and the streaming state.
  - Implements streaming delay detection mechanisms.

- SD Card Manager: 
  - Monitors SD card status on the device.
  - Handles SD card formatting.

---

Developed the Network Management Module:
- Notifies the frontend of the ping status of each ECG device and server-client latency.
- Introduced a dynamic timeout mechanism using a sliding window to adjust based on RTT trends.
- Built a fail-safe mechanism that suspends commands during severe network slowdown.

---

Introduced Resilience
- Introduced a task pipeline that guarantees proper execution and recovery at any failure point.
- Developed a message failure detection mechanism that identifies device error codes and applies corrective handling.

---

Bug Resolution
- Fixed a critical bug in patient session handling and streaming with a mechanism ensuring consistency and recovery on failure.

---

Built a virtual ECG that helps for running the server without a need of a physical device

Documented components with UML and technical diagrams ‚Äî widely used and praised across the team.

Handled production issues by SSH-ing into Linux servers, checking Docker logs, and exporting logs for debugging.

Deployed the **RIMPulse System** into **Docker Containers**
<!-- 
- Built a **logger** for the system, in which each directory is a hub contains logger files each hub is controlled by logger manager, logger files can be (enabled, disabled, deleted)
- Developed **unit & integration tests** for the features I implemented.
